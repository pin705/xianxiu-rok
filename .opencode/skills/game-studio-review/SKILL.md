# Game Studio Review

Use this after a concept, architecture pass, prototype, MVP, or release candidate needs a reality check.

## Required First Step

Start cross-platform with:

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/cgm.py doctor --root .
```

PowerShell review/asset/story gates remain legacy detail checks when PowerShell is available; their absence must not prevent the Python player-ready and commercial gates from running.

Do not claim the game was tested, exported, or playable unless there is evidence from a command, editor run, browser run, screenshot, playtest note, or user confirmation. Run `python3 ../../scripts/cgm.py style-lock verify --root .`; stale style context, unversioned drift, or unbound production assets are release blockers.

If `production/player-ready-contract.md` exists, run executable quality commands and the media-aware player-ready gate before classifying completion:

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/cgm.py player-ready --root .
```

If `production/commercial-release-contract.json` exists, also run:

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/cgm.py commercial-release --root .
```

## Review Workflow

1. Run `cgm.py doctor`, inspect the supported-version policy, and identify the target delivery state.
2. Validate that the quality manifest contains non-empty argv arrays and current hashed command evidence.
3. If implementation work is requested, require a small story and focused executable verification.
4. If a story is being closed, require checked acceptance criteria and command/runtime evidence.
5. If generated assets exist, run asset gates when available and always validate provenance, media signatures, runtime integration, and current captures.
6. Review actual visual/audio evidence pixel-by-pixel at full frame and runtime scale; file presence and self-authored PASS labels are insufficient. Final visual PASS must come from a human or clean-context independent agent that did not author the production surfaces. Reject a visual review that claims no findings while captures visibly contain overlap, clipping, distorted nine-slices, weak contrast, inconsistent asset families, generic first-pass art, tiny unreadable actors or decoration that defeats hierarchy.
7. For generated-asset playable showcases, check the scene scale plan and `playable-showcase-qa.md` evidence.
8. Run `../../tools/check-production-gate.ps1 -Root .` when epics/sprints exist.
9. Run `python3 ../../scripts/cgm.py player-ready --root .` when a player-ready contract exists.
10. Run `python3 ../../scripts/cgm.py commercial-release --root .` for release/store/gold-master claims.
11. Summarize evidence first: what was read, what was run, what could not be verified.
12. Apply the six useful role lenses plus player-journey, UI, audio, and asset-specific QA lenses:
   - Creative: pillar/hook/fantasy coherence.
   - Game Design: rules, loop, tuning knobs, MVP boundaries, acceptance criteria.
   - Art: art bible alignment, readability, asset coverage, prompt/provenance gaps.
   - Technical: engine/version/API/export risks, scene/resource structure, error-prone code.
   - Production: scope, sequence, dependency risk, smallest useful next step.
   - QA: smoke coverage, regression risk, playtest evidence, blockers.
   - Player Journey: validate each schema-v2 journey's declared start, transitions, required states, completion states, and recovery paths; do not impose conventional state names. Every passing manual playtest names its tester and build and binds current media with SHA-256.
   - UI/UX: art-bible and cross-asset coherence, hierarchy, safe zones, responsive layout, focus order, input prompts, accessibility, modal completeness, texture scaling, longest-copy layout, and runtime captures. The structured visual contract covers every required state × viewport, records look-dev selection/rejection, binds captures to a visual-smoke command, and leaves no unresolved high/blocker.
   - Audio: event coverage, buses, persisted settings, mix readability, provenance, pause/restart cleanup, and listening evidence. The passing review records reviewer/build and hashes the reviewed media.
   - Business: audience, positioning, price/model, scope economics, assumptions, and go/no-go criteria.
   - Accessibility: declared feature coverage, target-platform behavior, store claims, and qualified player review.
   - Localization/Narrative: string/branch completeness, glyphs, expansion, linguistic approval, and runtime evidence.
   - Platform/Performance: reproducible signed builds, target-device smoke, budgets, hashes, and store requirements.
   - Compliance/Security: licenses, AI provenance, privacy/data, ratings, terms, secrets, threat model, and approvals.
   - Marketing/LiveOps: truthful current store assets, telemetry/crash policy, support, incident, rollback, and patch readiness.
   - Sprite QA: frame count, alpha, chroma-key cleanup, edge touch, GIF preview, Godot pivot/frame metadata, runtime scale, grounding and coherence with the environment/FX family.
   - Map/Level Asset QA: preview, separated runtime objects, collision, zones, camera bounds, Godot scene/import readiness.
   - Godot Import QA: accepted assets resolve to project files, import intent is recorded, `res://` references are valid.
   - Playable Showcase QA: scene scale, grounding on large and small platforms, state machine, all pickup instances, finish trigger, web preview.
13. Classify the gate:
   - `PASS`: no blockers, evidence covers core play path.
   - `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS`: no blockers, but missing non-critical evidence or docs.
   - `BLOCKED`: crash risk, missing playable root/main scene, broken required files, unsupported claims, incomplete player journey, one-screen-only scope outside the agreed contract, mock/placeholder required assets, generic/default UI presented as final, missing required audio, missing state captures, or no manual core-loop playtest.
14. Write or update `production/reviews/review-[YYYYMMDD-HHMM].md` when the user asks for a formal review or when preparing a release/demo.
15. Update `production/session-state/active.md` with gate result, blockers, and next step.

## Player-Ready Classification

- `PROTOTYPE`: a technical/core-loop proof; incomplete content, presentation, or state coverage is expected and explicitly reported.
- `VERTICAL_SLICE`: one representative path approaches final quality, but the full bounded journey may remain incomplete.
- `PLAYER_READY`: the complete bounded journey is coherent and integrated; all required state, asset, UI, audio, test, runtime, and manual-playtest evidence passes.
- `RELEASE_CANDIDATE`: player-ready plus target-platform build, performance, packaging, legal/licensing, and release evidence.
- `COMMERCIAL_RELEASE_READY`: strict commercial gate passes for every declared target; external owner/store approvals are recorded.
- `RELEASED`: the authorized store/platform accepted the build and monitoring confirms launch health.

Never upgrade a result based only on effort or visual impression. Use the contract and evidence.

## Smoke Check Evidence

Prefer evidence in this order:
1. Automated command output.
2. Godot editor or CLI run notes.
3. Browser/Web export run notes.
4. Screenshot or short screen recording path.
5. User-confirmed manual playtest notes.

Minimum Godot MVP smoke checklist:
- Project root has `project.godot`.
- Main scene exists and is documented.
- Godot version is checked or the missing CLI is explicitly reported.
- Browser preview uses `../../tools/preview-godot-web.ps1 -Project .` when Godot CLI/export templates are available.
- Core input path is documented.
- At least one core loop playthrough is recorded in `production/playtests/`.
- Known blockers and warnings are listed.

Minimum player-ready evidence adds:

- Distinct runtime evidence for every required state in the game-specific graph; shared videos need distinct state markers.
- Complete asset coverage with accepted assets integrated into current runtime scenes.
- Verified asset presentation usages: aspect-preserving sprites/icons, dedicated tested nine-slices, justified cover crops/tiles, and current runtime composites.
- A schema-v1 visual quality contract with locked look-dev references, every required state × viewport, hash-bound captures, passing surface/cross-surface checks and no unresolved high/blocker.
- Keyboard and controller navigation evidence where the target supports both.
- Audio listening evidence for every required game-specific coverage row, busiest mix, transitions, and persistence/interruption behavior.
- Passing commands for every required journey/recovery path plus the declared engine-import, static-analysis, and reliability requirements, followed by a human/manual journey playtest.

Generated-asset playable showcase checklist:
- Scene scale plan exists and defines target runtime size for player, platforms, pickups, and finish.
- Player starts grounded and does not visually float or sink on large and small platforms.
- Idle is the default no-input state.
- Run/walk alternates feet and does not scale-pop.
- Jump uses phase frames for rise/apex/fall/land instead of a blind loop.
- Every repeated pickup instance animates and can be collected.
- Finish object is visibly anchored and triggers a clear state.
- Collision/debug rectangles are not visible in runtime.
- Web preview has been hard-refreshed after export so the current `.pck` is being tested.

## Story Gate

Use a story gate to prevent broad, vague implementation:
- Ready mode checks player value, goal, acceptance criteria, files to touch, and verification plan.
- Done mode also requires checked acceptance criteria and concrete evidence.
- Keep stories small enough to verify in one focused pass.
- Do not mark a story done because code was written; mark it done because acceptance criteria and evidence pass.

## Professional Mode

Treat aliases in `../../references/commands/catalog.yaml` as skill routing. Deterministic gate execution uses `../../scripts/cgm.py`.

`/release` and `/commercial-release` route to `game-studio-commercial-release`; `/hotfix` routes to `game-studio-liveops` plus focused review.

Hooks are also professional mode. Install them only when the user explicitly asks, using `../../tools/install-professional-hooks.ps1`.

## Web Search Requirement

Use web search and prioritize official docs when:
- Godot CLI/export commands, renderer behavior, input, web export, platform support, or API details are uncertain.
- The project uses a newer/different engine version than the local policy.
- The review concerns an engine error, export error, plugin compatibility issue, or generated asset import behavior.
- The user says generated assets or implementation results are unsatisfactory.

Record source links in the review report when they influence a finding.

## Output Style

- Lead with findings ordered by severity.
- Include file paths or evidence names.
- Separate blockers from warnings and improvements.
- Keep summaries short.
- Do not invent test results.
